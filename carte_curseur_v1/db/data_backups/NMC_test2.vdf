    The second indicator of military capabilities is military expenditures. <b>Military expenditure</b>
    is defined as the total military budget for a given state for a given year.
    Data Acquisition and Generation
    Since our primary interest was to index all financial resources available to the military in
    time of war, we coded all resources devoted to military forces that could be deployed, irrespective
    of their active or reserve status.
    Appropriations for all the types of units mentioned earlier were included when the units
    were under the authority of officials of the national government, even if the units did not contribute
    to the personnel variable. Such units typically were excluded from published budgets, in any
    case. It is important to note that in our assessments the sources of military expenditure data
    often provided gross (rather than net) expenditure figures.
    We sought to identify and exclude all appropriations of a non-military character because
    some nations have civil ministries under military control (national police forces is the most
    prevalent example). The use of such unadjusted budgets would substantially over-estimate the
    military capability of those nations. If there was a clear bureaucratic division between the
    execution of civil and military functions, this task was easily accomplished. For instance, if there
    were separate accounting and authorization procedures for merchant- and military-marine,
    expenditures of the former were excluded. On the other hand, merchant marine expenditures
    charged to the same administrative units which carried out military marine functions were
    included in the project's tabulations. Likewise, the budget figures were adjusted upward where we
    determined that outlays in other parts of the budget served to enhance military capacity.
    Having made the above distinction concerning money spent on military forces, we
    delimited part of the latter directly related to a country's war fighting capacity; that is, we had to
    distinguish which figures going for military purposes were destined to enhance capability. We
    deemed that expenditures on pensions, superannuation pay, relief, and subsidies to widows and
    orphans do not contribute to military power and excluded them where possible. For most
    statistically developed countries, these items were found to be readily identified in a separate
    section of the military budget, or charged outright to the finance ministry.
    We decided to identify gross rather than net expenditures, so as to sidestep problems of
    accounting for the yearly variations in stockpile buildup, depreciation, and liquidation. As with the accounting of energy stocks, little was found that would have allowed us to determine net
    expenditures.
    We closely attended to allocations, usually found in supplemental budgets, special
    accounts, and war credits and loans, over and above regular appropriations. Examples include
    the special funds and credits voted during the mobilizations prior to and during the two world
    wars, and the loans contracted by Prussia prior to the Franco-Prussian War.
    With regard to these special appropriations, some ambiguity exists as to which year the
    expenditures should be assigned. Since our objective was that each unit of currency spent on
    military capabilities should be counted only in the year that it directly enhanced military capability,
    it counted surpluses and credits transferred from past years (when known) among the
    expenditures of the referent year.
    For example, expenditures from special accounts (such as the construction of
    fortifications or the purchase of armaments) were included in the expenditure totals for that year.
    If the special account was composed of transfers from the general budget, expenditures on that
    account were included in the year in which they were spent or projected to be spent. If the special
    account was composed of credits budgeted to a war ministry in previous years, but unspent in
    those previous years, we included only actual expenditures from that account in the project's
    totals for the appropriate years. Outlays for the amortization of debts incurred were excluded,
    since the project had already counted them in the year in which the military items were acquired.
    Thus, if a naval ship was acquired in 1923 but not paid for until 1926, we counted the
    corresponding expenditure in 1923. Surplus military appropriations from previous years were
    counted as military expenditures only for those years when the funds were actually spent.
    The customary difficulties in Soviet statistics were resolved by period. For the years prior
    to the Second World War, the fragmentation of the evidence precludes an appraisal of real
    expenditures. Rather than engage in speculation, the project reported the official figures
    published in the League of Nations Armaments Year-Book from 1924 to 1940. From 1955 to 1963
    we utilized SIPRI estimates and from 1963 on have used ACDA figures.
    <b>Currency Conversion</b>
    In most cases, expenditures were originally collected in national currency. The data were
    then converted into a standard unit - British pounds sterling prior to 1914, U.S. dollars thereafter -
    using the COW currency conversion dataset (which uses current exchange rates). We entered
    beginning of the year market rates wherever available, except for periods of marked inflation in
    the twentieth century, where we entered black market rates, if available. This was the case for
    most Western nations throughout the data period, and for most nations since 1945. Otherwise,
    we used government rates, except for Eastern European states in the period after 1945, for which
    we used dollar amounts. In all remaining cases - most in the first half of the nineteenth century, for which documentation is particularly scarce - we used project estimates. Principal sources
    were the Times (London) for the years prior to 1914, League of Nations Statistical Yearbook for
    1919-1939, and International Monetary Fund from 1948 onward. Supplementary sources included
    de Gotha and Statesman's Yearbook, as well as economic and historical monographs.
    To moderate short-term fluctuations, we sometimes revised the resulting series by a
    smoothing process that used a seven-year moving average. A prime example of its application is
    the smoothing of rate changes during the wholesale suspension of the gold standard in the
    1930s. In the event of introduction of a new currency, we omitted this process. Occasional
    interpolations were performed to fill small intervals in a series, but only when currency conditions
    seemed stable. Data during extremely inflationary times (e.g. Germany during the early Weimar
    Republic) should be viewed with special care.
    <b> Problems and Possible Errors </b>
    It was often difficult to identify and exclude civil expenditures from reported budgets of
    less developed nations. For many countries, including some major powers, published military
    budgets are a catch-all category for a variety of developmental and administrative expenses -
    public works, colonial administration, development of the merchant marine, construction, and
    improvement of harbor and navigational facilities, transportation of civilian personnel, and the
    delivery of mail - of dubious military relevance. Except when we were able to obtain finance
    ministry reports, it is impossible to make detailed breakdowns. Even when such reports were
    available, it proved difficult to delineate "purely" military outlays. For example, consider the case
    in which the military builds a road that facilitates troops movements, but which is used primarily
    by civilians. A related problem concerns those instances in which the reported military budget
    does not reflect all of the resources devoted to that sector. This usually happens when a nation
    tries to hide such expenditures from scrutiny; for instance, most Western scholars and military
    experts agree that officially reported post-1945 Soviet-bloc totals are unrealistically low, although
    they disagree on the appropriate adjustments.
    We also encountered difficulty concerning lack of sufficient information about local
    currencies. Nineteenth century sources frequently shift from one name to another, for the same
    currency. Thus, Almanac de Gotha uses the "thaler", the "thaler en espece," and the "riksdaler"
    as currency unit names. After consulting several sources dealing with currencies, we determined
    all three to be the same unit. Occasionally, the sources report a budget, particularly of states
    newly independent in the nineteenth century, in different units from one referent year to the next.
    Thus, Statesman's Yearbook and Almanac de Gotha report Guatemalan expenditures first in
    silver pesos and later in paper pesos. Although we encountered situations in which currencies of
    the same name but of different values were in circulation, usually the values were sufficiently
    different to distinguish by comparison the units in question. Not surprisingly, these difficulties were less prevalent in later years. Thus, SIPRI informed us that their series are always
    represented in the most recent currency unit, to which prior data are adjusted. Again, usually the
    scale of the reported figures is indicative of the referent unit.
    A final problem concerning currency conversion is conceptual in nature. When comparing
    economic magnitudes across time or space, there is a choice to be made concerning what price
    weights apply to what quantities of each good or service under consideration. Our particular
    choice of standard units (sterling and dollars) implies a decision to assign these weights to each
    nation's military program according to British or U.S. opportunity costs for the referent year. This
    choice is implicitly made when the project converts local currency units to sterling or dollars, for it
    is then computing what Britain or the U.S. would have given up in order to make the same
    purchases. Given the relatively free international monetary and trade movements that obtained
    during much of nineteenth century, in which pounds sterling, dollars, francs; deutschmarks, lira,
    etc., were readily convertible into each other, there was arguably a single world economy. These
    opportunity costs would then have been approximately the same for any standard unit, since
    each nation was drawing on this single economy. In the most autarkical situations that
    occasionally arose in the twentieth century, the opportunity costs were no longer roughly
    equivalent; the relative monetary costs often depended on the currency in which they were
    expressed. This was the situation during the world wars, when normal monetary and commercial
    exchange was disrupted.
    The most extreme cases, however, are the economies of the Soviet Union, China since
    1949, and the centrally directed economies of Eastern European states since 1945, for which
    there has been relatively little freedom of movement. Here, one might find Soviet military
    expenditures exceeding U.S. expenditures, when they are valued in U.S. dollars, but the reverse,
    when they are both valued in rubles. Moreover, because Soviet prices were set by fiat rather
    than by market bidding, the prices of military goods and services, compared among themselves
    or to civilian items, are not necessarily reflective of their relative value in the sense that we
    normally ascribe, even as measured in the local currency. These difficulties compound the
    problem we noted earlier, that the military accounts in question have often been distorted or
    partially hidden to outside eyes. Like others before it, we found no way around these inherent
    ambiguities. In the cases noted, we simply stuck with them.
    <b> The Future of Military Expenditures </b>
    Two tasks exist relevant to the future of the military expenditure data. First, the military
    expenditure data set requires that there be a consistent, accurate, and well documented currency
    conversion data set. Raw military expenditure data often come in a variety of different monetary
    units, such as rubles, dollars, pounds, franks, or marks. Because of these differing units, it is quite important to have a universally accepted and accurate key for converting all those raw data
    values into one common metric.
    Unfortunately, the original COW Currency Conversion data set appears to have been lost
    to time, and so although we have converted expenditure variables, we do not have the
    conversion series.
    If a new version of the currency conversion data set could be completed, a second major
    endeavor of the military expenditure data set could begin: the re-documentation of the data
    points before approximately 1960.
    <b> Quality/Anomaly Codes </b>
    There are no quality or anomaly codes for this component.
    <b> Component Data Set Layout </b>
    The layout of the data set is found in Table MILEX 1 below. The data set contains six
    columns. The first and second columns correspond to the COW state abbreviation and COW
    state number, respectively. The third column is the year of observation. The fourth column
    contains the value for that year (from 1816 to 1913, in thousands of current year British pounds
    and from 1914 onwards, in thousands of current year U.S. dollars), unless the value is missing.
    Missing values are indicated by -9. The fifth and sixth columns contain any information that was
    available from the original COW project. Since we did not attempt to verify this data, these
    columns are often left blank, in cases where we could not find any information about sources from
    the original project.
